    "3. Change the function `plot_example_errors()` so it also prints the `logits` and `y_pred` values for the mis-classified examples.\n",
    "4. Use `sparse_softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits` instead of `softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits`. This may require several changes to multiple places in the source-code. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using the two methods.\n",
    "5. Remake the program yourself without looking too much at this source-code.\n",
    "6. Explain to a friend how the program works."
